# 🎯 Number Guessing Game (Python)

This is a simple **Number Guessing Game** written in Python. The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it. After each guess, the program gives feedback whether the guess should be higher or lower, until the correct number is guessed.

## 🧠 How it Works

- The computer picks a random number between 1 and 100.
- You (the user) try to guess the number.
- After each guess:
  - If your guess is too high, it says "Lower Number Please".
  - If your guess is too low, it says "Higher Number Please".
- When you guess it right, the program congratulates you and shows the total number of attempts.
